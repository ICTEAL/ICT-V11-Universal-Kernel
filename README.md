# Information Curvature Theory (ICT) V11
**A Unified Computational Kernel for Gravity, Energy, and Complexity by EthanAndrewLang**

## Abstract
ICT V11 replaces the Dark Sector (ΛCDM) with a Complexity-Weighted Manifold. [cite_start]By introducing a **Quartic Screening Mechanism ($x^4$)** and a **Stagnant Core** solution, this framework resolves the Hubble Tension, the Information Paradox, and the Early Galaxy Maturity problem (JWST z>14). [cite: 1, 2]

## Key Predictive Benchmarks
* [cite_start]**Stagnant Core Echo:** 165.4 Hz (Falsifiable signature for LIGO O4 residuals). [cite: 2]
* [cite_start]**Milky Way Edge Velocity:** ~230 km/s (Achieved via L_const and Complexity Index C=1.5). [cite: 4]
* [cite_start]**Succession Principle:** Explains mature galaxies at z > 14 as inherited geometric data ("Warm Boot"). [cite: 3]

## Strategic Applications
* [cite_start]**Stabilized Fusion:** Projected Q > 25.0 via magnetic topology screening. [cite: 4]
* [cite_start]**AGI Alignment:** Isomorphic grounding in manifold complexity. [cite: 5]

## Operational Kernel
See `verification_kernel.py` for the Python implementation of galactic rotation curves without dark matter.
